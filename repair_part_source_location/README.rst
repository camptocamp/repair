In a normal context when parts are added in a repair order, a stock move
is created with source location got from the Operation Type. With this
module, we can define a different source location.

Usage
=====

When creating or editing a repair order, you can set a source location
for the parts that will be used in the repair order. This source
location will be used when creating stock moves for the parts. If no
part source location is set, the source location will be taken from the
operation type, as usual.
